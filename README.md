### Description
News duplication is a common issue nowadays. And it's not just about news, literally everything available on the web2 world can be copied and misused if there's no patent.
But no worries, we have the Blockchain technology as our savior. We can store any transaction happening on the blockchain which will serve as a **Proof Of Existence**.

Coming to our project, XCheck is a platfrom where news channel can post their news and the transaction hash will be stored on the blockchain i.e the document is timestamped and securely stored on the Ethereum Blockchain.
